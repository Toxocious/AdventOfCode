  <h1 align="center">Advent of Code</h1>

  [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like, created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).

  I love the aspect of Advent of Code and want to participate it in every year. I started late, but intend on retroactively going back and completing available puzzles from previous years eventually.
